A bitter pill
A hot potato
A dime a dozen
Ace in the hole
Achilles' heel
All ears
All thumbs
An arm and a leg
Apple of discord
At the drop of a hat
Back to the drawing board
Ball is in one's court
Balls to the wall
Barking up the wrong tree
Basket case
Beating a dead horse
Beat around the bush
Bed of roses
Bird Brain
Bite off more than one can chew
Bite the bullet
Bite the dust
Bought the farm
Break a leg
Burn the midnight oil
Bust one's chops
By the seat of one's pants
By the skin of one's teeth
Call a spade a spade
Call it a day
Chomp at the bit
Cheap as chips
Chew the fat
Chink in one's armor
Clam up
Cold shoulder
Couch potato
Crocodile tears
Cut a rug
Cut the cheese
Dig one's heels in
Don't count chickens before they hatch
Don't have a cow
Drop a dime
Elephant in the room
Fit as a fiddle
For a song
Fly in the ointment
From A to Z
From scratch / to make from scratch
Get bent out of shape
Grasp the nettle
Have eyes in the back of one's head
Head over heels
Heard it through the grapevine
Hit The Nail On The Head
Hit the road
Hit the sack
Hit the spot
Hook, line and sinker
Ignorance is bliss
Jump ship
Just my two cents
Kick the bucket
Kill two birds with one stone
Let the cat out of the bag
Look a gift horse in the mouth
Method to (one's) madness
Nip (something) in the bud
No horse in this race
Off one's trolley or <br>
Off the hook
Once in a blue moon
Pop one's clogs
the pot calling the kettle black
Preaching to the choir
Pull somebody's leg
Pushing up daisies
Put the cat among the pigeons
Right as rain
Rock the boat
Shoot the breeze
Shooting fish in a barrel
Step up to the plate
Screw the pooch
Sleep with the fishes
Spill the beans
Spin one's wheels
Straw that broke the camel's back
Take the biscuit
Take the cake
Take with a grain of salt
Throw under the bus
Through thick and thin
Thumb one's nose
Tie one on
To steal someone's thunder
Trip the light fantastic
Two a penny
Under the weather
The whole nine yards
Wild goose chase
